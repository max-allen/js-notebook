The story goes that when Brendan Eich went to Netscape in 1995, he wanted to put a functional language called Scheme in the browser. The Netscape folks turned down the idea, thinking that no one would want to write an "academic" language, and told Brendan to write a language like Java. He responded by producing a language that looked like Java, but was in actuality closer to Scheme.
